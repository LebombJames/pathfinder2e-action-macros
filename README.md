# pathfinder2e-action-macros
A compendium pack that includes macros to add all untrained actions, and trained actions split into each skill.

# Install
Manifest link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LebombJames/pathfinder2e-action-macros/main/module.json

On the Foundry setup screen, go to add-on modules and click Install Module at the bottom. Paste this link in the address box at the bottom.

# Usage
After enabling the module, go to your compendium list and find the Actions compendium. Right click it and chose unlock. 

*(Before running any macros, backup your actors! It's very easy to accidentally run a macro twice and have to delete the dupliates manually!)*

Then select the token you want to add actions to on the scene and excecute the macro you want.

# Macros Included
**Basic Actions** - Includes all Basic Actions, Speciality Basic Actions (excluding spell related ones), untrained skill actions and downtime/exploration activities.
Note that Generic Skill Actions are inluded, regardless of if you are trained in any of their requirements.

**[SKILL] Actions** - Includes all trained skill actions and downtime/exploration activities for the skill listed. 
If there isn't a macro for a particular skill, then there are no trained skill actions linked to that skill.

**Spell Actions** - Includes all actions related to spellcasting.
