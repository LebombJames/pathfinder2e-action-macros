# pathfinder2e-action-macros
A compendium pack that includes a macro to add all untrained actions and trained actions, with options for each skill.

# Install
Manifest link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LebombJames/pathfinder2e-action-macros/main/module.json

On the Foundry setup screen, go to add-on modules and click Install Module at the bottom. Paste this link in the address box at the bottom.

# Usage
### **V1.1 And Newer**

There is now a button on the sheet to run the macro. While most of the time running the macro this way works as intended, there are some cases it may add to the wrong sheet depending on the token selected/the actor linked to your Foundry user, so it's still best to place a token on the canvas and have it selected when you run it.

Of course, you can still run the macro the old way if you wish.

### **Previous Versions**

After enabling the module, go to your compendium list and find the Actions compendium. Right click it and chose unlock. Then, drag the Add Actions Macro to your macro bar.

*(Before running any macros, backup your actors! While there is now duplicate prevention, you may still add a bunch of actions you don't need or want!)*

Then select the token you want to add actions to on the scene, excecute the macro, then choose your options and hit Add Actions.

# Options Explained
**Basic Actions** - Includes all Basic Actions, Speciality Basic Actions (excluding spell related ones and ones available due to a special movement), untrained skill actions and Downtime/Exploration activities.

**Skill Actions** - Options for Trained Skill Actions and respective Downtime/Exploration activities. If there isn't a macro for a particular skill, then there are no trained skill actions linked to that skill. (Note that Occultism, Religion and Nature only have actions that other skills give. In other words, Identify Magic and Decipher Writing can be used with various skills, so don't be alarmed if, upon becoming trained with any of these on a skill increase, no actions are added.)

**Additional Miscellaneous Actions** - Options for Spell Actions and actions related to Burrowing and Flying.
